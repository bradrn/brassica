# Brassica example files

These example sound change files and lexicons demonstrate different aspects of Brassica’s functionality:

- `latin2port.bsc` is a set of sound changes from Latin to Portuguese.
  These demonstrate the form of simple sound changes in Brassica.
  (These were originally collected by Mark Rosenfelder for his [SCA²](https://www.zompist.com/sca2.html).)
- `english.bsc` contains sound changes to infer Modern English forms from Early Middle English.
  These demonstrate sporadic sound changes, category combining,
    and several stages of phoneme inventory evolution.
- `thai.bsc` contains sound changes from Proto-Tai to modern Thai.
  These demonstrate phonetic features and the autosegmental treatment of tone.

These examples are also available in the [online version](https://bradrn.com/brassica).
